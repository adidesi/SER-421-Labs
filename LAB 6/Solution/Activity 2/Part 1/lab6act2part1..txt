However, when the dimensions are modified and the site is loaded, the server takes in considerations the device dimensions and loads data accordingly. Example different layout for mobile and desktop devices

The site is responsive in nature. 
As the device width changes, the website takes into consideration that smaller screens must be smaller devices and changes the content displayed on the screen.

There is no change in content restructuring, or layout of information on screen. The site only shrinks/enlarges in width, as the width of the device keeps changing.The content is made compact horizontally and not moved vertically or structurally changed. Such behavior is found in fluid layout websites
